### Built using

For the past few months I have been working with **HTML and CSS**, so this is what I am using to build this app

- **HTML**: For structure
- **CSS**: For styling

### Structure

```sh
MY-SITE/

├── CSS               # CSS file
├──── styles.css      # styling file
├── images            # client-side script
├── index.html        # structure file

```

## Roadmap

If you want to contribute check it out [open issues](https://github.com/dpertsin/my-site/issues) for a list of issues and improvements.

## Contributing

If you are interested in helping it would be great any contributions will be welcomed.

## Feedback

If you find and see and issue please open one issue or if you need/want a feature you can also make a request for said feature.

## Deployment on the Web

I am a big fan of HTML, CSS and the **Netlify** team so it's only natural to be deployed there.

## Running app locally

If you wish to contribute or add a feature

`git clone https://github.com/dpertsin/my-site.git`

`git checkout -b your_name`

## Credits

I would appreciate if this code helped you build yours first simple website, to mention me.

## License

I want it simple and permissive. That's why I am using [MIT License](https://github.com/dpertsin/my-site/blob/master/LICENSE).
The MIT License is short and to the point. It lets people do almost anything they want with your project, like making and distributing closed source versions.

## Enjoy!
Don't forget to play around with the code and practice with it!
